    "\n",
    "For this problem, I decided to create the array of the odometer reading to be created programatically. To do so, the following steps were done:\n",
    "1. Research on total miles between NYC to Key West, Florida by bike. Found this to be equal to 1,551 miles.\n",
    "2. Divided total miles (1551) by 35 days since it is said that I will be arriving at my destination on the 35th day. This was found to be equal to around 44.31 days.This information was used to generate random numbers. This is the reason why the random numbers generated was decided to be between 40 and 60.\n",
    "3. For the 4 non consecutive days that I did not do anything, 35 days was divided by 4. Since this is equal to 8, it was decided that I will take a rest every 8th day. Therefore, this was incorporated on the code such that if it is the 8th, 16th, 24th, and 32nd day, my odometer reading will not change.\n",
    "4. Lastly, on the 35th day, the code forces the array to have the total miles, that is, 1551.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of Numpy:**\n",
    "Numpy was first used to generate random integer numbers between 40 and 60 and also with a size of 35. List was created to store odometer reading and later on this list was converted back into an array using numpy. Lastly, numpy was used to create a new array that prints out the total miles covered each day."
